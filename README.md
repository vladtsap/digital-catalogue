- [ ] edit book with PUT request method 
(update in DB, without creating-deleting an object and as a result â€” changing id)
- [ ] delete book without JS script workaround
- [ ] use [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org)
- [ ] use static files
[reference 1](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/howto/static-files/) [reference 2](https://stackoverflow.com/a/33993532/13897744)
