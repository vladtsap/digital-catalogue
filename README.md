# LAG project 

Digital catalogue for Lviv Art Gallery

### TODOs

- [ ] update README
- [ ] remove empty params from query
- [ ] review (and rework?) book search
- [ ] cover code with unit tests
- [ ] edit book with PUT request method 
(update in DB, without creating-deleting an object and as a result — changing id)
- [ ] delete book without JS script workaround
- [ ] use [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org)
- [ ] use static files
[reference 1](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/howto/static-files/) [reference 2](https://stackoverflow.com/a/33993532/13897744) 
- [ ] one-field search through all fields in db
- [ ] add/edit/delete book in admin panel only
